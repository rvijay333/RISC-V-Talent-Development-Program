This is the TASK 1 .
The code is first typed in leafpad editor

the c-code is run in risc-v compiler using -O1 optimization flag it is seen here at the main block the number of instruction set is 15

next in similar way we will run the c-code in risc-v compiler using -Ofast optimization flag it can be seen that the number of instruction from has reduced to 12 instruction set , we can say that the processing speed increases
