# Task-1

## Description
This is the TASK 1.  
The code is first typed in the *leafpad editor*.  

The C code is run in the RISC-V compiler using the -O1 optimization flag. It is seen here that at the main block, the number of instruction sets is *15*.

Similarly, we run the C code in the RISC-V compiler using the -Ofast optimization flag. It can be seen that the number of instructions has reduced to *12 instruction sets*, which indicates that the processing speed increases.

### Example: 
- *Main ending address* = 101B0  
- *Main starting address* = 10184  
  Subtracting them:  
  101B0 - 10184 = 2C  
  2C รท 4 = 0B (11 instructions) using -Ofast.

Similarly, when we repeat the process using -Ofast, the instructions reduce, indicating a faster way.

# Task-2

## Description
In this task we understand the way to debug the code.
we use specific commands to , check the values stored in our registers and pointers . This hepls us to manage and understand the functioning of the code .
we also compile and get the output of our code in risc_v compiler .
