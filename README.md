# Task-1



##
This is the TASK 1 .
The code is first typed in leafpad editor

the c-code is run in risc-v compiler using -O1 optimization flag it is seen here at the main block the number of instruction set is 15

next in similar way we will run the c-code in risc-v compiler using -Ofast optimization flag it can be seen that the number of instruction from has reduced to 12 instruction set , we can say that the processing speed increases

example : main ending address = 101B0 
main starting address = 10184 
subtracting them --> 101B0-10184=2C
2c รท 4 = 0B ( 11 instructions ) . using O1 


similarily.. when we repeat the process using Ofast . the instructions reduce. indicating its a faster way .
